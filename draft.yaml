# General Notes
# This document is a very rough, first draft of what I was thinking of.
# Written in YAML, so that I can use Anchors and write comments. It is serializable to JSON.
#
# I have included comments/notes on the specific key/value pairs. Most of them are self-explanatory.
#
# All `source` nodes should use URIs. Any non-URI, is considered 'internal'
# `resource` and `audio` keys are treated as 'internal' resources, and are fetched to that location from the `source`
#
# For example, `/cover.jpg` would mean 'inside the container, filename cover.jpg'
# Whereas `file://users/desktop/cover.jpg` would mean 'outside the container, in the users filesystem
# and `http://somewhere.com/cover.jpg` would be a HTTP resource
# I don't know how feasible it is, but an option to 'fetch' the resources would be nice.
#
# I have honestly over-complicated this example to show its flexibility. In point of fact, only a tiny handful
# of the 150,000+ audiobooks I have processed *ever* reach this level of complexity.
# The average book is 10 hours long, with a number of audio files, and maybe a single PDF.
#
# In the Audiobook industry, complexity on the side of the Author is usually normalized in the contact
# negotiation stage. Audiobooks are a very 'flat' structure product.
#
# I have included one option for handling a complex playlist structure.
#
# I have to warn you though - NO publisher currently produces audiobooks with *any* kind of structure. Even getting
# publishers to agree to "One File per logical unit of audio" is basically impossible.
#
# You have my permission to redistribute this file in any format, including posting to public forums.
# It is not necessary to credit me for the work

# `book` covers the simplified book-level metadata for display. Additional keys can be added as appropriate
# This hash represents the common fields we use at Blackstone
# `cover` is a resource reference. The key is resolvable in the `resources` hash
# This is the information that is displayed before any audio is downloaded i.e. in the users 'library'

# Now some will argue that "Audiobooks Need Structure". I say that is not true, Print books need structure.
#
# There are *never* any contractual obligations regarding how track lists appear. This is because
# it is not something that we have ever (or will ever) have universal control over.
# Should that ever change, the most that could be asked for would be "best efforts" - which this allows.
#
# Oh, and *no* publisher captures this level of structure for audio.
#
# Below is a deliberately complex example, just to demonstrate the idea
# The nominal idea here, is a Publisher can communicate the desired format/layout of the tracks
#
# So we can hint at a layout/style/structure, but there is no obligation on the part of the developer
# beyond displaying the 'label''
playlist:
  - label: "Part One"               # Label for the group. 'null' would display no label.
    style: "book-section"           # Default CSS Style for Playlist entries

# The example above would display similar to this:
# [* means it would play a track]
# ---
# Part One
#  In The Beginning *
#  War is Coming *
#  The War
#   Fight! *
# Part Two
#  Winners *
#  Losers *
# ---
#
# Honestly, what you will probably see most often is this:
#playlist:
#  - contents:

#        audio: "/6729-001.m4a"
#      - label: "Track 2"
#        audio: "/6729-002.m4a"
#      - label: "Track 3"
#        audio: "/6729-003.m4a"
#      - label: "Track 4"
#        audio: "/6729-004.m4a"
#      - label: "Track 5"
