# General Notes
# This document is a very rough, first draft of what I was thinking of.
# Written in YAML, so that I can use Anchors and write comments. It is serializable to JSON.
#
# I have included comments/notes on the specific key/value pairs. Most of them are self-explanatory.
#
# All `location` nodes should use URIs. Any non-URI, is considered 'internal'
# For example, `/cover.jpg` would mean 'inside the container, filename cover.jpg'
# Whereas `file://users/desktop/cover.jpg` would mean 'outside the container, in the users filesystem
# and `http://somewhere.com/cover.jpg` would be a HTTP resource
# I don't know how feasible it is, but an option to 'fetch' the resources would be nice.
#
# I have honestly over-complicated this example to show its flexibility. In point of fact, only a tiny handful
# of thew 150,000+ audiobooks I have processed *ever* reach this level of complexity.
# The average book is 10 hours long, with a number of audio files. Some may have a single PDF
# In the Audiobook industry, complexity on the side of the Author is usually normalized in the contact
# negotiation stage. Audiobooks are a very 'flat' structure product.
#
# I have included one option for handling structure. Another would be to define the audio resources as collections
# then use anchors to include them in the audio resources hash.
#
# I have to warn you though - NO publisher currently produces audiobooks with *any* kind of structure. Even getting
# publishers to agree to "One File per logical unit of audio" is basically impossible.
#
# You have my permission to redistribute this file in any format, including posting to public forums.
# It is not necessary to credit me for the work

# `book` covers the simplified book-level metadata for display. Additional keys can be added as appropriate
# This hash represents the common fields we use at Blackstone
# `cover` is a resource reference. The key is resolvable in the `resources` hash
# This is the information that is displayed before any audio is downloaded i.e. in the users 'library'
